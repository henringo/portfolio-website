The project utilizes Gradle as the build automation tool for managing dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application. The architecture follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with proper encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The codebase adheres to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) and GRASP principles (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) to ensure maintainable and extensible code. Multiple design patterns are implemented including Builder for complex object creation, Factory for object instantiation, State for managing game states, Strategy for different enemy behaviors, Fa√ßade for simplifying complex subsystems, and Observer for event handling. The game features smooth gameplay mechanics, collision detection, scoring system, and progressive difficulty levels, all built with clean, well-structured code that serves as an excellent example of professional software development practices."

The platform integrates transcript parsing, WAM forecasting, schedule management, and AI-powered features including unit recommendations and automated assignment marking with rubric-based feedback.

Built as a group project with a modern full-stack architecture (Next.js frontend, Spring Boot backend, PostgreSQL database), the application addresses the challenge of navigating complex degree requirements and scattered academic information by consolidating planning tools into a unified experience.

My contributions focused on backend API development, authentication systems, Units of Study (UoS) management, resume functionality, and the AI marking pipeline that processes PDF/DOCX submissions using GPT-4 for intelligent feedback generation.`,

      detailedDescription: `CUSP AI ‚Äì USYD Planning & Study Assistant

A full-stack web application inspired by the University of Sydney's official CUSP platform, designed to help students navigate degree planning, academic progress tracking, and study management through intelligent automation and AI assistance.

Problem Statement:
Students struggle to translate USYD's complex rules‚Äîprerequisites, credit point requirements, progression pathways‚Äîinto actionable study plans. Academic information is scattered across official portals, unit handbooks, and personal documents like transcripts, making it difficult to maintain a clear view of progress and plan future semesters effectively.

Solution:
CUSP AI consolidates these needs into a single, intuitive platform that automates transcript parsing, provides WAM forecasting with target setting, manages schedules and assignments, and offers AI-powered unit recommendations based on academic history and preferences.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Transcript Processing: Upload PDF transcripts with automatic parsing to build structured academic records
‚Ä¢ WAM Forecasting: Calculate current WAM, set target goals, and visualize trends with interactive charts
‚Ä¢ Unit Recommendations: AI-powered suggestions based on transcript analysis and student preferences
‚Ä¢ Smart Scheduling: Calendar integration with Google Calendar for holidays, plus AI-generated study schedules from assignment due dates
‚Ä¢ Assignment Marking Assistant: Automated rubric extraction and GPT-4-powered feedback on submissions (PDF, DOCX, images with OCR)
‚Ä¢ Study Bot: Socratic tutoring chatbot for course guidance and academic support
‚Ä¢ Course Reviews: Community-driven unit reviews with compatibility scoring

Technical Stack:
‚Ä¢ Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
‚Ä¢ Backend: Spring Boot (Java), RESTful APIs, JWT authentication
‚Ä¢ Database: PostgreSQL (Docker)
‚Ä¢ AI Services: OpenAI GPT-3.5/GPT-4 for recommendations, marking, and chat
‚Ä¢ External Integrations: Google Calendar API for holiday overlays

My Contributions (Group Project):
As part of the development team, I was responsible for:
‚Ä¢ Backend API architecture and REST endpoint development
‚Ä¢ Authentication system (JWT-based login/signup flow)
‚Ä¢ Units of Study (UoS) management features (CRUD operations)
‚Ä¢ Resume builder functionality
‚Ä¢ Marking system implementation including file ingestion (PDF/DOCX/OCR), rubric extraction via GPT-3.5, and chunk-based GPT-4 marking pipeline with annotation generation

The project demonstrates full-stack development skills, API design, authentication best practices, integration with AI services, and collaborative software development in an academic context.
